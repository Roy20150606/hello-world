# I AM
My name is Roy Kim. I live in Seoul, Korea.  
I'm a software engineer/evangelist who work in NAVER.  
I love programming, like to travel to a new place and meet new people.  
The reason I started this page is simple. To keep track of myself.  
'Better late than Never'. Any contact is always welcome.
