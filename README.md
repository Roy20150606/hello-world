# hello-world
personal coding(algorithm, personal records, SQL, data analysis, etc)

I'm a Software-Engineer who works in Samsung SDS.

Known/Heard about the Git HUB for almost an year. I've always made excuses of using the GIT.

Better late than never.

Here is one more step to my bright future.

Have a nice day:)
